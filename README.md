# sfx-lab

A small, standard-library-only Python CLI that learns which sound effects you
like. An agent proposes specs, a generator makes audio, you rate sounds in the local Studio, and the agent updates a short `taste.md` for the next batch.
The installer downloads Python for you.

## Install

Tell Claude Code: “Install the SFX Lab skill from <repo>, then open SFX Lab.”

Connect ElevenLabs: elevenlabs.io → profile → API Keys → Create → Copy →
SFX Studio gear → paste → Save. Keep the key out of chat. Blur or delete the
key in recordings. Then ask Claude Code for sounds, such as “Make me 6 whooshes.”

For a manual install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frmwrkd-explained/sfx-lab && cd sfx-lab && sh install.sh
```

On Windows, run `./install.ps1` in PowerShell (untested). The installer installs
uv when needed, downloads Python 3.12, and links the Claude skill. It uses your
existing library, asks for a folder in a terminal, or uses `~/SFX Lab` when run
by Claude Code. Pass `--lab DIR` to choose a folder (PowerShell: `-Lab DIR`).
Re-running is safe; an existing skill folder is backed up.
`sh install.sh --uninstall` (PowerShell: `./install.ps1 -Uninstall`) removes the
tool and installed skill, never your library.

Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in your environment or in the lab's `.env` file (add
`.env` to your own lab's gitignore). Never paste keys into chat. By default the
agent uses your installed Claude Code login and the `haiku` model; no Anthropic
API key is needed. To use the direct API, set `agent` to `anthropic-api` in
`.sfx-lab/config.json` and set `SFX_LAB_ANTHROPIC_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
Its default model is `claude-haiku-5-5`; configure `model` to override it.

```sh
sfx-lab init ./my-sounds
sfx-lab --lab ./my-sounds batch "soft UI click for a tech explainer" -n 6
sfx-lab --lab ./my-sounds open
# Listen, rate 1–5 stars, add notes, then click Update taste.
sfx-lab --lab ./my-sounds learn
sfx-lab --lab ./my-sounds status
```

Generation asks before spending. In a script, check the plan's estimate, then
use `run --yes` (or `batch --yes`). The default cost cap is $0.50 per batch;
change `max_usd` in config or pass `--max-usd`. To inspect before generating:

```sh
sfx-lab plan "dry paper transitions" -n 6 --kind foley
sfx-lab run --yes
```

Without `--lab`, discovery checks `SFX_LAB_DIR`, walks up from the current
folder, then uses the last initialized lab recorded under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sfx-lab/config.json` (default `~/.config/sfx-lab/config.json`).
Run `sfx-lab --help` for all commands.

Rate 1–5 stars: 1 discards a sound; 2–5 keep it. Words `love` (5), `good` (4),
`ok`/`meh` (3), `bad` (1), emoji ❤️/👍/👎, and `4★`/`★★★★`/`4 stars` also work
in optional Markdown sheets. The old numeric aliases `0` and `-1` are removed;
`1` and `2` now mean one and two stars. Existing word-based logs migrate in
memory when read. Ratings and notes save immediately; settlement happens once,
on the next **Update taste** / `sfx-lab learn`, using the latest stars.

## Sound-design an edit

Install `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on PATH, then score a video:

```sh
sfx-lab score ./edit.mp4 --project my-show
sfx-lab score ./edit.mp4 --no-agent --plan-only
# After reviewing the saved cue table and price:
sfx-lab score --resume <score-id> --yes
sfx-lab line "Here is the reveal." --voice <existing-voice-id> --at 00:00:03:12 --project my-show
```

`score` imports a source copy into the lab, detects cuts and brief frame-change
spikes, and asks the configured agent (normally Claude CLI / Haiku) for specific
prompts. `--no-agent` uses deterministic prompts. It saves JSON and a Markdown
cue table, prints the table, reuses matching takes rated at least 4 stars in this
project, and shows the generation estimate before asking to spend. `--yes` skips
the question but keeps the default $0.50 batch cost cap from project settings;
`--max-usd X` explicitly overrides it. Resume keeps successful takes after a partial failure.

The built-in SFX default is `eleven_text_to_sound_v3`. Use `score --sfx-model v2`
or configure the generator as `elevenlabs-v2` to select v2. SFX estimates show
40 credits per second plus the existing $0.12/minute dollar estimate; the two
published units are not a universal exchange rate. Your plan determines billing.
Agent usage is separate. `line` uses `eleven_v4` with an existing voice id and
the same approval/cost gate, estimating $0.08/1,000 input characters. It never
creates a voice clone. Time accepts seconds or `HH:MM:SS:FF`, non-drop-frame at
the edit's frame rate. Lines go into the latest score in that project; use
`--score <score-id>` to choose another.
Rates were checked against the [SFX guide](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/capabilities/sound-effects)
and [ElevenAPI pricing](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing/api) on 2026-10-28.

Deliverables live in `scores/<project>/<score-id>/`: `<name>.scored.mp4`,
`<name>.sfx-stem.wav`, cue JSON/Markdown, FCPXML and EDL. The stereo 48 kHz WAV
stem peaks at or below -3 dBFS. Effects duck by 9 dB under detected speech with
80 ms ramps. Optional local Whisper needs an installed CLI and a cached
`tiny.pt` model, or `SFX_LAB_WHISPER_MODEL` pointing to a downloaded model file.
No model is downloaded automatically. Without Whisper, original voice ducking
is unavailable and the plan says so; added voice lines still duck the effects.
Cuts and graphic hits are heuristics and need listening review. The MP4 is an
H.264/AAC review render with original audio plus the stem, at the probed average
frame rate; use the preserved source for lossless/HDR finishing.

Open Studio and pick the **Cue sheet** tab to review a score: watch the edit
before and after, click any cue on the timeline to jump to it, give its take
stars, swap it for another take, then render again. Stars here teach your taste
exactly like a normal batch. See [SCORE_SPEC.md](SCORE_SPEC.md) for the JSON
contract and saved-file schema.

### Import into an editor

Both exports start at `00:00:00:00` and use non-drop-frame labels. Match the
timeline frame rate and start timecode, including 23.976/29.97 fractional rates.
The EDL contains marker events and comments, not audio or an editable SFX mix.
FCPXML links to local media paths; keep the source, library takes and stem
available, or relink them after moving the lab.

| Editor | What to import | What arrives and what does not |
|---|---|---|
| Final Cut Pro | File → Import → XML, choose `.fcpxml` | A project with source picture, cue-id **clip markers**, one audible connected mixed stem, and disabled reference takes named by cue id. The references are raw audio; the stem contains the ducking and peak control. This EDL is not a native Final Cut marker import. |
| DaVinci Resolve | For markers on an existing timeline: Media Pool → right-click timeline → Timelines → Import → Timeline Markers from EDL. Choose `.edl`. | The Resolve-specific marker comments provide cue names and durations. Set the timeline start to zero, rather than Resolve's common one-hour default. Import `.fcpxml` through File → Import → Timeline for picture/stem clips; marker/disabled-clip translation varies by version, so use the EDL route for markers. Importing the EDL as a normal timeline gives cut events, not the mixed stem. |
| Premiere Pro | Import the WAV and place it at elapsed zero. For an editable timeline, convert `.fcpxml` to legacy Final Cut Pro XML with a separate tool first. | Premiere cannot directly import modern FCPXML. Its CMX3600 import reads edit events, not Resolve's marker extension, so this EDL does **not** provide Premiere markers or audio clips. Native Premiere marker XML is not exported here. |

These routes are based on [Apple's XML import guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/use-xml-to-transfer-projects-verdbd66ae/mac),
[Apple's clip-marker model](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional-video-applications/describing-final-cut-pro-items-in-fcpxml),
[Adobe's FCPXML conversion requirement](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere/desktop/organize-media/import-files/migrate-from-final-cut-pro-x.html),
[Adobe's CMX3600 import documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/pdf/cs6/premiere_pro_reference.pdf),
and [Simon Says' documented Resolve marker workflow](https://www.simonsaysai.com/blog/export-for-blackmagic-davinci-resolve-timeline-markers-bc6678d323ac).
The exports are tested offline for structure and timing. Native import in these
three editor apps has not been tested in this build; prompt notes and disabled
reference clips may translate differently. The cue table remains authoritative.

## Studio

```sh
sfx-lab open
sfx-lab open --project my-show
sfx-lab stop
sfx-lab studio
sfx-lab studio --no-open --port 8765
```

`open` starts Studio in the background or reuses it; `stop` closes the server.
Set `SFX_LAB_NO_BROWSER=1` to suppress browser launching.
Studio binds to `127.0.0.1` and opens your browser unless `--no-open` is set.
It runs until Ctrl-C; port `0` selects a free port. It serves local package
assets and lab audio, with a per-run token protecting every API call.

- Library list/grid, search, sorting, batch grouping, prompt tags and filters.
- One player with a waveform, loop playback, remembered level matching (on by default), and 1–5 star ratings and notes.
- Project switcher, New project, This project / All sounds, and Settings for project defaults and write-only keys.
- New batch planning with estimates and the configured cost cap, generation
  progress, and **More like this** with parent/child lineage.
- Map from features decoded in your browser, batch comparison and blind tests.
- Insights, real Sound taste sections, editable **My notes**, and **Update taste**.
- Keyboard: Space plays/pauses; arrows select; 1–5 rate and play the next unrated;
  0 clears; N writes a note; I toggles details; L/M/C/G switch views; ⌘K/Ctrl-K
  searches; ? shows shortcuts. Both system light/dark themes and reduced motion work.

New labs have `"sheets": false`. Set `"sheets": true` in `.sfx-lab/config.json`
to also write Markdown rating sheets. Existing configs without this key keep
sheets enabled. Studio updates the corresponding sheet fields; on learn, newer
sheet edits win and stale sheets cannot overwrite a Studio rating. Generated
sounds, including failures, live in the append-only `.sfx-lab/sounds.jsonl`
catalogue; older sheets are imported automatically. Cached browser features and
unrated notes stay inside `.sfx-lab/`. Jobs run locally; generation still uses the
configured generator and planning/learning still uses your configured agent.

All browser dependencies are vendored with licences under
`src/sfx_lab/studio/vendor/`; no runtime CDN or frontend build is needed:

- wavesurfer.js **7.8.6** — BSD-3-Clause (`wavesurfer.LICENSE`).
- @tanstack/table-core **8.20.5** UMD — MIT (`table-core.LICENSE`).
- Geist and Geist Mono variable WOFF2 from geist **1.3.1** — SIL OFL 1.1 (`geist.LICENSE`).

See [STUDIO_SPEC.md](STUDIO_SPEC.md) for the frozen Studio contract.

`taste.md` contains a generated profile, best/worst examples, and statistics.
Planning loads the project hot card and relevant taste, good/bad and recent-prompt slices. **My notes is
yours**: write permanent preferences there. Learning preserves your notes and
other text outside the auto markers, updating only the generated block and the
`modified`/`ratings` frontmatter values. `learn --no-agent` refreshes the
examples and numbers while retaining the previous profile.

For optional sheets in Obsidian, set `"sheets": true`, use the default `--embed obsidian` and open the lab folder as a
vault or put it inside one. Audio embeds reference filenames. For other Markdown
tools, `init --embed html` writes audio tags with relative paths. Taste, batches,
and audio paths are configurable; `frontmatter` in the lab config merges custom
metadata into newly written notes.

You can supply specs yourself without calling the agent:

```sh
sfx-lab plan "soft click" --specs specs.json
```

The JSON array accepts `prompt`, `duration_s` (null or 0.5–30),
`prompt_influence` (0–1), `loop`, `kind`, `explore`, `why`, and `from`
(a parent sound id, or null).
See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the complete frozen behavior.

## Projects and context

```sh
sfx-lab project new "Tech Explainers" --description "My weekly show"
sfx-lab use tech-explainers
sfx-lab context
sfx-lab find "dry whoosh"
sfx-lab need "dry whoosh" -n 3
sfx-lab ratings --tag whoosh --stars 4-5
sfx-lab show 2026-10-23-01-01
sfx-lab taste --full
```

Every lab has `general`. Existing labs keep all files in place, including their
configured taste file; old records belong to `general`. New projects store taste
and a ≤1,400-character deterministic hot card in `projects/<slug>/`. Ratings and
notes are per project while audio stays shared. `project new --from <slug>` copies
the source's taste auto block and defaults. `project list` and `project show`
inspect projects. Selection: global `--project` → `SFX_LAB_PROJECT` → `use` → `general`.

`need` offers ≥4★ matches first and plans only the missing count. Use `--generate`
for a new batch. Planning uses compact context, relevant good/bad examples and the
last ten overlapping prompts in this project, with a bad-repeat guard and one
replacement round. `plan --verbose` prints prompt characters and approximate tokens.
`learn` updates only the active project's taste, including a bounded `## Hot`
section. Only ratings in a sound's originating project can settle that sound.

Studio Settings writes keys to `<lab>/.env` with mode 0600; APIs return only
connected/missing status. Choose Claude Code login (when installed) or an Anthropic
key. Project defaults override lab settings. `studio --ready-json --no-open --port 0`
prints one JSON line containing the bound URL, local API token and lab root for
local launchers.

## Claude Code skill

From the repo root, install the skill:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && ln -s "$PWD/skill" ~/.claude/skills/sfx-lab
```

Alternatively, copy the `skill` folder to `~/.claude/skills/sfx-lab`. Then ask
Claude for sound effects.

## Custom generators

Adapters are duck typed and need no sfx-lab imports. Instantiate with no arguments:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any, Protocol

class Generator(Protocol):
    name: str

    def estimate_usd(self, spec: dict[str, Any]) -> float: ...

    def generate(self, spec: dict[str, Any], dest: Path) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Write atomically to dest.with_suffix(".wav") (or another extension).
        # Return {"path": str, "ref": str, "cost_usd": float | None}.
        # Raise an exception with a human-readable message on failure.
        ...

    def settle(self, ref: str, keep: bool) -> None:
        # Called once during learn after a rating; keep is false only for 1 star.
        ...
```

Register a class under the `sfx_lab.generators` entry point group, or set the
lab's `generator` to a dotted path such as `my_package.sounds:MyGenerator`.
Plans and sheet markers retain the generator name for generation and settlement.


The built-in ElevenLabs estimate uses $0.12 per minute ($0.002 per second),
with five seconds estimated for automatic duration. Agent usage runs on your
Claude Code login/subscription or your Anthropic API key and is separate from
the generation estimate. ElevenLabs output rights depend on your plan.
